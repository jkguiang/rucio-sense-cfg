 Max Goncharov from MIT wrote a set of python scripts (attached) that can be used by XRootD to calculate and store the checksum in a separated file. The caveat of using this approach is that on a file deletion, the checksum file is not deleted. You can either:
>  - run a cron to find and clean unused checksums OR
> - modify the script to not store the checksum and let XRootD to calculate it every time

> In order to use the scripts one needs the following in the XRootD configuration:
>   xrootd.chksum max 24 adler32 [PATH TO adler.py]
>
> if you are using the multiuser plugin make sure you comment out the following directive:
>   #ofs.ckslib ++ libXrdMultiuser.so

> NB: Somebody testing the script commented about the following error in the code:
